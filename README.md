To whoever will be doing the source code review of this, this is the best i can do for a 4.5 hours of coding. There are a lot to improve and some functions still not fully working. Please do undesrstand that I do have a lot to improve in terms of hands-on coding. 

Anyway, I hope that y'all have a good day.

Thank you.
